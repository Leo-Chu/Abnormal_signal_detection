# Abnormal_signal_detection
We provide three kinds of indicators for the abnormal_signal_detection


Notes:

1、 PCA is the method proposed in "Xie, Le, Yang Chen, and P. Roshan Kumar. "Dimensionality reduction of synchrophasor 
data for early event detection: Linearized analysis." IEEE Transactions on Power Systems 29.6 (2014): 2784-2794."

2、 indicator_from_my_work.m is the method proposed in "Chu, Lei, et al. "Massive streaming pmu data modelling and 
analytics in smart grid state evaluation based on multiple high-dimensional covariance test." 
IEEE Transactions on Big Data 4.1 (2017): 55-64."
